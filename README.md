# misc-scripts
A showcase of some of the miscellaneous scripts I've created that are too small for their own repos.

  - **umls_search.py**: queries the [Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) database](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/index.html); may be used as a first-pass dictionary approach for a named object recognition pipeline for biological terms in COVID-19 articles.
  - **twitter_search.py**: takes in search parameters either from a user input or from a [CoronaWhy](coronawhy.org)-curated database of drug names found in COVID-19 papers, then saves the resultant tweets to a csv file for use in a sentiment analysis.
